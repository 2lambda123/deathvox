		A weapon category. This currently doesn't do anything, but please still put the weapons in the
		correct category, both for cleanliness and so we can do stuff with it later (eg, potentially moving
		weapons into different tabs in the purchase screen depending on where they are here).

		Also note that there is no technical basis for the IDs - please keep them to lowercase, numbers and
		underscores, however you can call them whatever you like - I'd recommend copying the names from the
		spreadsheet for consistency.

			A weapon tag - specifies the various properties about a weapon.

			The name used here must be the name used internally by PD2. For some weapons (eg, amcar and ak74) it's
			immediately obvious what weapon it corresponds to in-game, but for other weapons (such as p226, which
			is the Signature .40) please leave a comment on the previous line or at the end of the line noting the
			in-game name.

			Additionally, please feel free to use comments to explain why you made a certain change.
