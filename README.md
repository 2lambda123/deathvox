Crackdown difficulty for PAYDAY 2

**Installation Instructions for Crackdown:**

**Step 1**. Install **SuperBLT**  
SuperBLT is a “hook” that is the foundation of payday 2 modding. Installation is simple.  
First, search your Payday 2 folder for a file named iphlpapi. Delete it. This is an outdated version of the mod hook that will be replaced. If you don't see the file, that's fine!  
Second, download SuperBLT. The latest version is available at:  
https://znix.xyz/random/payday-2/SuperBLT/latest-wsock.php  
Simply place the file in your Payday 2 folder and run Payday 2.  
_Note that if you have the BLT hook installed, this utility will replace it. You will also need to delete your PAYDAY 2/mods/base folder._  
SuperBLT has all of the functions of BLT, and more- and is actively updated, effectively superseding it.  

**Step 2**. Install/Update **Beardlib**  
Beardlib is a foundational modding platform. Please make sure it is installed and up to date before proceeding to the next step.  
Beardlib can be downloaded from:

Installation Instructions are available on the site.  

**Step 3**. Install **Crackdown**
