Simultaneous chopper events

Opened roof and balcony doors at spawn
added gman locational spawn to surveillance
localization fixed.

gman swapin


Notes:
Add rooftop guard? no, no nav in area.
consider lasers in vault? no, not needed, no good surfaces for laser structure.
Consider increased loot req; what will current spawn structure bear? Not needed, current req nicely splits the difference.
Change trap enemies? No, not needed.
