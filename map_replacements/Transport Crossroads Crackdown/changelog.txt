Notes:
Note this heist was edited without consideration for lower difficulty adjustment.

Note that immediately prior to launch, an irregularity in asset extraction caused a crash on load. We had to remove several props (all vent models from roofs) to make the map run. Some of these vents serve as cover; We have recorded their locations and will restore them in a later patch if it becomes possible and if time permits.
